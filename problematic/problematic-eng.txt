En dash: homoglyph	4713702	eng	In modern professional tennis, winning a big tournament is considered a greater achievement than winning several smaller tournaments of the same combined value. Hence, top players typically concentrate on bigger tournaments and only play a few smaller ones in between. Consequently, top players play and win fewer matches than before. Since Ivan Lendl won 106 out of 115 matches he played in 1982, nobody won more than 90 matches in a single season, except Roger Federer, who went 92-5 in 2006.

En dash: homoglyph	10726729	eng	There were many kinds of early Christians. Some sects never made it to the present time. One of them was the Ebionites, from the Hebrew "ebyonim" for poor. They revered Jesus' supposed brother James the Just, but rejected the missionary Paul of Tarsus. They believed that Mary was not a virgin and that Jesus was adopted by God. The Ebionites were vegetarians. There were many other extinct sects of Christianity. At that time, the distinction between Jews and Christians was not really clear-cut. Another sect that is extinct today is the Marcionites. Marcion of Sinope (circa 85-160 CE) wrote books that did not survive to the present day; one book that he wrote was The Antitheses. Unlike the Ebionites who still followed Jewish Law and thought that Jesus was human, not God, the Marcionites rejected Jewish Law and thought that Jesus was God, not human. The Marcionites believed that there were 2 gods, the Creator God of the Jews and the God of Jesus. Jesus was the God of mercy and love; he was to save people from the wrathful Creator God. "Docetism" is the term used for thinking that Jesus was a phantasm that appeared human. Marcionites believed that Jesus was not born into this world. Their canon was something like the New Testament, but more compact, and phrases that Marcion thought were scribes' earlier modifications had been elided.	nonong	2022-03-20 09:50:49	2022-03-20 23:07:35

Research your illness day and night. Take breaks with art or creative writing. Keep your brain working! Add superfoods with antiviral properties one by one. Force yourself to be a Sherlock Holmes and know more than your doctor. Socialize 2 hours a day and strive for a peaceful recovery that lowers cortisol and adrenaline. Drinking gallons of fermented milk significantly lowers your cortisol and stress. The Mongols conquered the world with this trick by drinking a fermented horse mare milk called kumis, also called airag. Try to kill viruses with the best and safest antiviral superfoods.
