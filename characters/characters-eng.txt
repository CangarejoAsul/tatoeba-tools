In the Philippines, my native Tagalog from childhood has Spanish words embedded in it. I eventually took Spanish at university in BC. I had introductory French in Grade 5 on Lulu Island, continued it in high school, then in post-secondary education. I have learned the rest autodidactically. I have reading strength in my languages, but not much in speaking, except in Esperanto, in which I have attained a high level, partly due to my participation in various clubs. I enjoy reading novels in the different languages, especially in the genres of science fiction and fantasy, as I immerse myself in far-flung worlds. Romanian is for me still a vampiric curiosity, which I have not explored much. Additionally, I am curious also about Ladino, also known as Judeo-Spanish.

I remember a spacious hall with hardwood floors and a Buddha altar in front. In summers, the doors would be open to the sunny green outside. In the wetter seasons at night, candles would be lit in the silent darkness inside. (I wore a black Australian Outback jacket then.) Omnipresent was the Ajahn Bhoontam in orange robe, he conducting the rituals. Our saṅgha or congregation was medium-sized and multiethnic. A real saṅgha full of Thais allowed us to share the rustic building. The two groups met at different times.	nonong	2022-03-01 15:35:48	2022-03-01 15:35:48

7778	0x1e62	Ṣ	1	10735386	eng	Like Christianity and Judaism, Islam is a so-called Abrahamic religion. Muslims, as Islamic people are called, repudiate Christianity's Trinity which alludes to polytheism. Islam is strictly monotheistic as they believe that there is only One God, Allāh. Their sacred writings are in the Qur'an, divided into 114 suras, containing 6236 āyāt, verses. Muslims believe that the Qur'an is only perfect in the original Arabic because any translation would be deficient. Their main prophet is Muhammad, the messenger. Muslim eschatology includes bodily resurrection at the Day of Resurrection, Yawm al-Qiyāmah, when everyone will be judged for good or bad deeds. Trials and tribulation precede and coincide with al-Qiyāmah, the time of which no human knows. (I read somewhere too that in Islam, being in hell may be an impermanent condition.) Like other Abrahamicists, Muslims believe in angels. Muslims believe in predestination or divine preordainment. Muslims must pray 5 times during the day. The prayer rituals are called Ṣalāh. Like other religions, Islam has subdivisions, as the Sunni and Shia, the contention being the successor, Abu Bakr or Ali respectively, to Muhammad. (The Islamic religion's progression and overall ambiance are depicted in Frank Herbert's Dune series, which is set thousands of years from now in outer space. There is a desert planet called Arrakis.)	nonong	2022-03-24 17:54:25	2022-03-24 18:10:06
