122	0x7a	z	1	12283086	enm	And certaynly our langage now vsed varyeth ferre from that whiche was vsed and spoken whan I was borne. For we englysshe men ben borne vnder the domynacyon of the mone, which is neuer stedfaste but euer wauerynge, wexynge one season and waneth & dyscreaseth one season. And that comyn englyssche that is spoken in one shyre varies from a nother. In so moche thay in my dayes happened that certayn marchauntes were in a ship in tamyse for to haue sayled ouer the see into zelande, and for lacke of wynde thei taryed atte forlond, and wente to lande fr to refreshe them. And one of theym named sheffelde, a mercer, cam in to an hows and axed for mete, and specyally he axed after eggys. And the goode wyf answerde that she coude speke no frenche. And the marchaunt was angry, for he also coude speke no frenche, but wolde haue hadde egges, and she vnderstode hym not. And thenne at laste a nother sayd that he wolde haue eyren, then the good wyf sayd that she vnderstod hym wel. Loo! what sholde a man in thyse dayes now wryte, egges or eyren? Certaynly it is harde to playse euery man by cause of dyuersite & chaunge of langage.	Ooneykcall	2024-01-24 06:25:17	2024-01-24 06:25:53
