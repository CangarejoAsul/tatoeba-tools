And that comyn englyssche that is spoken in one shyre varies from a nother. In so moche thay in my dayes happened that certayn marchauntes were in a ship in tamyse for to haue sayled ouer the see into zelande, and for lacke of wynde thei taryed atte forlond, and wente to lande fr to refreshe them. And one of theym named sheffelde, a mercer, cam in to an hows and axed for mete, and specyally he axed after eggys. And the goode wyf answerde that she coude speke no frenche.
